# simple-2d-stack-game
A simple 2D stacking game with a jumping and moving mechanic. The player object at the moment can only jump, but even then its jumping isn't stable. It will jump at various heights at any press of the "Jump" button. I would like to add a movement mechanic that's only activated when the player object is in the air. These are all I'm working on at the moment.

I'll be adding more features in the future. Feel free to fork this repo for yourself.
